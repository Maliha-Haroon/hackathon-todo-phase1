# Todo Console App

A command-line todo application for managing tasks in memory.

## Project Overview

This is a simple console-based todo application that allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete

## Features

- Add Task: Create new todo items with titles and descriptions
- View Tasks: Display all tasks with their completion status
- Update Task: Modify existing task details
- Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list
- Complete Task: Toggle task completion status

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture with three main components:
- `main.py`: Entry point and application loop
- `todo_manager.py`: Business logic and data management
- `ui.py`: User interface and interaction

## Usage

Run the application with Python 3.13+:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Phase 1 - Project Setup

This is Phase 1 of the Todo Console App implementation following spec-driven development.
